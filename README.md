## Very miminal NPM package starter

just spamming the npm reg as JS fanbody :)

## Installation Guide

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build and run the ts file

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

or you can add script on package.json that uses this command with a single alias.

3. Remotely login to npm registry

```bash
npm login

```

4. Publish to npm registry

```bash
npm publish

```
